## About Me

I am an 18-year-old systems architecture developer obsessed with complex and difficult problems.

My core interest lies in low-level software development. If an architecture does not permit this, I adapt without hesitation—but my instinct is always to go as close to the metal as possible. I prefer building libraries from scratch, understanding every abstraction I rely on, rather than consuming them blindly.

I started programming at the age of 11 with Android development. Through web development, I gradually learned how real-world systems are structured. That long journey gave me deep experience in REST APIs, Linux server administration, DevOps, and cybersecurity.

My curiosity for Linux eventually led me to Arch Linux, where I took my first serious steps into low-level development and system-oriented thinking.

Parallel to all of this, I have an fascination with the human brain. I have run many experiments—none of them successful yet—but failure has never stopped me. Understanding intelligence, emergence, and behavior is not a side interest for me; it is something I intend to solve.

Today, this is no longer just an interest or a career path.
It is simply how I live.
